# Gamelytics Motel Pricing Game 🏨📈

This project was completed as part of a **Business Analytics simulation** on [Gamelytics.net](https://www.gamelytics.net/motel-pricing-game.html).  
The objective was to maximize motel revenue by dynamically adjusting prices based on **day of the week** and **weather conditions** using **Python**.

## Project Overview
>>>>>>> 37e9e19 (Initial commit: Gamelytics Motel Pricing Optimization Project)
- Simulated 30 days of pricing decisions for 100 identical motel rooms  
- Modeled relationships between **price**, **weather**, and **demand**  
- Built linear regression and visualization tools to optimize daily pricing  
- Achieved near-capacity booking levels through data-driven decision making  

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- Regression analysis and demand forecasting
- Data visualization for pricing and weather segmentation

---

##  Key Insights
- **Weather** strongly influenced price elasticity and occupancy rates  
- **Weekday vs. weekend** pricing adjustments yielded limited revenue lift  
- Discovered price thresholds beyond which demand dropped sharply
